## How to run

* Download the dataset and add it to the **dataset** directory (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00468/)
* Install the necessary libraries:
    * NumPy
    * Pandas
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
    * scikit-learn
    * xgboost
    * collections
    * imblearn

* You are ready to run the notebook!
    
All the cells already have the output underneath. If you choose to run, keep in mind that the commented cells take very long to run and are not necessary. Especially the GridSearch code block, that finds the best parameters, and the creation of the features graphs. To be able to run the classification algorithms you need to run everything that is part of the data analysis and the data pre-processing, except the plots.
